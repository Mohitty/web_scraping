Introduction To Selenium:

Selenium is a free (open source) automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms.
Testing done using Selenium tool is usually referred as Selenium Testing.
Selenium is not just a single tool but a suite of software's, each catering to different testing needs of an organization. 
It has four components.
  * Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  * Selenium Remote Control (RC)
  * WebDriver
  * Selenium Grid
At the moment, Selenium RC and WebDriver are merged into a single framework to form Selenium 2.


Introduction To Webdriver:

The WebDriver proves itself to be better than both Selenium IDE and Selenium RC in many aspects. 
It implements a more modern and stable approach in automating the browser's actions. 
WebDriver, unlike Selenium RC, does not rely on JavaScript for Automation. 
It controls the browser by directly communicating with it.

webdriver is used:
    To use a certain programming language in designing your test case.
    To test applications that are rich in AJAX-based functionalities.
    To execute tests on the HtmlUnit browser.
    To create customized test results.
So, basically we use selenium webdriver(provides firefox,chrome, IE etc webdrivers) to interact with the browser.

Installation And Setup:

You can download Python bindings for Selenium from " https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium ". 
However, a better approach would be to use pip to install the selenium package. 
Python 3.6 has pip available in the standard library. 
Using pip (install pip if you don't have it), you can install selenium like this:
     -> pip install selenium
 
Installing driver:
Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. 
For example I am using Firefox which requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. 
Make sure itâ€™s in your PATH, e. g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.

To download geckodriver go to ' https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases "
