PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND SOURCE FOR LEARNING:

To start web sraping you need to have a programming experience.
I learned python for the purpose.
A good source is Learn Python The Hard Way and the python documentation.
Doing all exercises will give a very good hand on practice in python.

FRAMEWORK FOR BROWSER AUTOMATION:

Selenium is the frmework that i used for the scraping.
It supports many languages including python(i would prefer it over java or other language for this purpose)
Installation and other setup process are given in the file named Selenium.

#This project is still under progress and I will further update the features and components as i go through :)
